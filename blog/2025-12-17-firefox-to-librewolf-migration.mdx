Mozilla just [named a new CEO](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozillas-next-chapter-anthony-enzor-demeo-new-ceo/). The headline promise? Firefox will "evolve into a modern AI browser." I read that and immediately started looking for alternatives.

This is a quick migration guide, not comprehensive documentation. Check [LibreWolf's official docs](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq/) for your specific system.

I was worried about breaking things—my setup has shell aliases for profile switching, wrapper scripts, keyboard shortcuts that launch Firefox, and window management automation. Everything migrated in about 30 minutes. If it worked for me, it'll work for you.

## Why Leave Firefox?

Mozilla's December 2025 announcement outlined three priorities:

1. AI must be "clear and understandable"
2. Revenue diversification beyond search
3. Firefox growing into "a broader ecosystem"

None of these say "leave users alone."

## The Alternatives

<DataGrid
  columns={[
    { key: 'browser', label: 'Browser' },
    { key: 'engine', label: 'Engine' },
    { key: 'features', label: 'Key Features' }
  ]}
  data={[
    { browser: 'LibreWolf', engine: 'Gecko (Firefox fork)', features: 'Zero telemetry, uBlock Origin pre-installed, hardened defaults' },
    { browser: 'Mullvad Browser', engine: 'Gecko (Tor fork)', features: 'Best anti-fingerprinting, designed for VPN use' },
    { browser: 'Ungoogled Chromium', engine: 'Chromium', features: 'Pure Chromium with all Google code removed, truly FOSS' },
    { browser: 'Zen Browser', engine: 'Gecko (Firefox fork)', features: 'Privacy-focused, vertical tabs, minimal UI' }
  ]}
/>

**My pick: [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/).** It's Firefox without Mozilla's telemetry. Same Gecko engine, same extensions, same workflow. uBlock Origin comes pre-installed. Updates track Firefox releases within days (currently at Firefox 146). Firefox Sync is disabled by default but you can enable it.

## Installation

Multiple options. This guide uses Flatpak:

<DataGrid
  columns={[
    { key: 'method', label: 'Method' },
    { key: 'command', label: 'Install Command' },
    { key: 'notes', label: 'Notes' }
  ]}
  data={[
    { method: 'Flatpak', command: 'flatpak install flathub io.gitlab.librewolf-community', notes: 'Sandboxed, auto-updates, profiles in ~/.var/app/...' },
    { method: 'Native (Debian/Ubuntu)', command: 'sudo apt install extrepo && sudo extrepo enable librewolf && sudo apt install librewolf', notes: 'Faster startup, profiles in ~/.librewolf/' },
    { method: 'Native (Arch)', command: 'yay -S librewolf', notes: 'AUR package, native performance' },
    { method: 'AppImage', command: 'Download from librewolf.net', notes: 'Portable, no install needed' }
  ]}
/>

```bash
flatpak install flathub io.gitlab.librewolf-community
```

I used Flatpak because it's available on Pop!_OS. Trade-off: slower startup, profiles live in `~/.var/app/io.gitlab.librewolf-community/.librewolf/`.

For webcam access (video calls), grant device permissions:

```bash
flatpak override --user io.gitlab.librewolf-community --device=all
```

If you choose native install, adjust paths from `~/.var/app/io.gitlab.librewolf-community/.librewolf/` to `~/.librewolf/`, and binary from `flatpak run io.gitlab.librewolf-community` to `librewolf`.

## Migrating Data

LibreWolf can import everything from Firefox in one step:

Settings → General → Import Browser Data → **Import Data**

This imports bookmarks, passwords, history, and autofill data.

## Fix Broken Sites

LibreWolf's strict tracking protection can break some sites. Enable this:

Settings → Privacy & Security → Enhanced Tracking Protection → **Fix major site issues (recommended)**

## Keep Logins Persistent

By default, LibreWolf deletes cookies when closed—you'll have to re-login everywhere. Either disable it or add exceptions for sites you use:

Settings → Privacy & Security → **Delete cookies and site data when LibreWolf is closed**

## Setting Up Profiles

LibreWolf supports Firefox-style profiles:

```bash
# Open profile manager
flatpak run io.gitlab.librewolf-community -P

# Or launch specific profile
flatpak run io.gitlab.librewolf-community -P "Work"
```

If you use multiple Firefox profiles, create matching ones in LibreWolf's profile manager, then copy the data:

```bash
# Copy bookmarks and passwords (adjust profile names)
cp ~/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE_NAME/places.sqlite \
   ~/.var/app/io.gitlab.librewolf-community/.librewolf/PROFILE_NAME/

cp ~/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE_NAME/logins.json \
   ~/.var/app/io.gitlab.librewolf-community/.librewolf/PROFILE_NAME/

cp ~/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE_NAME/key4.db \
   ~/.var/app/io.gitlab.librewolf-community/.librewolf/PROFILE_NAME/
```

## Extensions

Same Firefox Add-ons store. uBlock Origin comes pre-installed.

Extension settings don't transfer automatically, but most extensions support exporting settings to JSON. Vimium-C, uBlock Origin, and others have Settings → Export/Import. Quick way to move your keybindings and configurations.

## Updating Dotfiles

### Shell Aliases

Update any aliases that reference `firefox`:

```bash
alias firefox='flatpak run io.gitlab.librewolf-community'
```

### System-Wide Wrapper

Aliases don't work in scripts or desktop files. Create a wrapper so all `firefox` calls use LibreWolf:

```bash
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/firefox << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
exec flatpak run io.gitlab.librewolf-community "$@"
EOF
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/firefox
```

This is the key trick—no changes needed to existing scripts. Everything that calls `firefox` just works.

### Default Browser

```bash
xdg-settings set default-web-browser io.gitlab.librewolf-community.desktop
```

Verify:

```bash
xdg-settings get default-web-browser
# io.gitlab.librewolf-community.desktop
```

## What Changes

| Item | Firefox | LibreWolf (Flatpak) |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Binary | `firefox` | `flatpak run io.gitlab.librewolf-community` |
| Profile path | `~/.mozilla/firefox/` | `~/.var/app/io.gitlab.librewolf-community/.librewolf/` |
| Telemetry | On by default | Disabled, can't enable |
| Firefox Sync | Enabled | Disabled by default (can enable) |
| uBlock Origin | Manual install | Pre-installed |

## The Result

Everything works. Firefox stays installed as backup for now.

```bash
sudo apt remove firefox
```
