Similar to DevOps, Platform Engineering struggles to define a platform concisely. A good way to understand what a platform is, is to list various kinds of platforms and their characteristics.

![Platform Types](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3062/1*cRQ7MFBTxnZA-xORwNlciQ.png)*Platform Types*

* **Business as a Platform:**
Consider Uber, the entire product is a platform that connects users and drivers. This platform creates an ecosystem where businesses operate, users engage, and interactions happen seamlessly.

* **Domain-Specific Platforms:**
These platforms provide cross-cutting functionality for other applications. An example could be a geolocation API that is consumed by web frontend, mobile app and other services.

* **Domain-Agnostic Platforms:**
These platforms serve as foundational building blocks for developers, offering essential tools like database management, cloud storage, and user authentication. Cloud platforms like AWS or Azure provide the infrastructure and services that countless digital products rely on and are a good mental model to have when designing our own cloud native platform.

The platform landscape is vast and varied. From business-centric models to specialized domain platforms and versatile tools for developers, each plays a pivotal role in the digital ecosystem.

In this blog, we will focus on **domain-agnostic platforms** providing infrastructure.

### The Case for Cloud-Native Platforms
> # Cloud-native is about how applications are created and deployed, not where. — Priyanka Sharma

Cloud-native platforms provide a foundation that allows applications to be designed with flexibility, largely making them environment agnostic. A well-architected platform offers several key benefits:

### Self-service portal

A self-service portal is a user-friendly interface that allows users to access and manage resources independently, empowering developers and users to create, configure, and deploy resources without IT support. This streamlines workflows, accelerates project timelines, and enhances productivity.

Examples like [Backstage](https://backstage.io/), developed by Spotify, and [Port](https://getport.io/) provide customizable interfaces for managing developer tools and services, ensuring efficient and consistent interactions. These portals embody the essence of self-service, enabling quick, autonomous actions that reduce bottlenecks and foster agility in development processes.

### Programmatic APIs

Programmatic APIs are the backbone of cloud-native platforms, enabling seamless interaction with platform services and functionalities. These APIs allow developers to automate tasks, integrate different services, and build complex workflows, enhancing efficiency and consistency across environments.

APIs provide programmatic access to essential platform features, allowing developers to automate repetitive tasks and streamline operations. They support various transport mechanisms such as [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP), and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), offering flexibility in how services communicate. For instance, API based on [Kubernetes Resource Model](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/build-platform-krm-part-2-how-kubernetes-resource-model-works) enables developers to manage containerized applications, while [AWS SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/) facilitate interactions with a wide range of cloud resources. By leveraging programmatic APIs, platforms ensure that developers can efficiently build, deploy, and manage applications, driving productivity and innovation.

### Automated Workflows

Automated workflows are crucial for provisioning and deployment processes in cloud-native platforms. They ensure tasks are executed consistently and efficiently, minimizing human error and enhancing productivity.

Key to these workflows are CI/CD pipelines, which automate the build, test, and deployment stages of application development. Tools like [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) and [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) enable [GitOps](https://opengitops.dev/) practices, where infrastructure and application updates are managed through Git repositories. By leveraging automated workflows, platforms can ensure rapid, reliable deployments, maintain consistency across environments, and accelerate the overall development process.

### Monitoring and Observability

Monitoring and observability tools provide crucial insights into the performance and health of cloud-native platforms. These tools help detect issues early, understand system behavior, and ensure applications run smoothly.

Prominent tools include [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for collecting and querying metrics, [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for visualizing data and creating dashboards, and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for tracing and observability. Together, they enable proactive management of resources, quick resolution of issues, and comprehensive visibility into system performance. By integrating these tools, platforms can maintain high availability and performance, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Security and Governance Controls

Integrated security and governance controls are vital for maintaining compliance and protecting sensitive data in cloud-native platforms. These controls ensure that platform operations adhere to security policies and regulatory requirements.

Tools like [OPA GateKeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper), [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/), and [Falco](https://falco.org/) play a crucial role in enforcing security policies, managing configurations, and detecting anomalies. OPA GateKeeper and Kyverno help in policy enforcement and compliance, while Falco specializes in runtime security and intrusion detection. By incorporating these tools, platforms can ensure robust security, maintain compliance, and mitigate risks effectively.

### Ever Evolving
