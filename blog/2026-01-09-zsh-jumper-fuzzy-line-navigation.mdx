You've typed a 10-word kubectl command. You realize the namespace is wrong. Now you're holding `Ctrl+Left` six times to get there. Or worse, reaching for the mouse.

Vim solved this for text editing decades ago. Why are we still navigating command lines like it's 1985?

[zsh-jumper](https://github.com/Piotr1215/zsh-jumper) brings fuzzy search to command line navigation. Press a key, pick a word, cursor jumps there.

## The Problem

Terminal commands grow long:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system --output wide --selector app=nginx
```

You need to edit `kube-system`. Options:

1. **Arrow keys** - Hold until you get there. Slow.
2. **Ctrl+Left/Right** - Jump word by word. Better, but still multiple presses.
3. **Home then Ctrl+Right** - Start from beginning. Indirect.
4. **Mouse** - Works, but your hands leave the keyboard.

None of these scale. A 15-word command means 15 potential targets.

## The Solution

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system --output wide
                    ▲
              [Ctrl+X /]
                    │
         ┌──────────┴──────────┐
         │      jump>          │
         │  1: kubectl         │
         │  2: get             │
         │> 3: pods            │
         │  4: -n              │
         │  5: kube-system     │
         │  6: --output        │
         │  7: wide            │
         └─────────────────────┘
```

Type `kube`, hit enter. Cursor lands at `kube-system`. Edit, continue.

The mental model matches how you think: "I want to change the namespace" not "I need to move left 6 words."

## Installation

Requires fzf (or sk, peco, percol). Most of you have fzf already.

```zsh
# zinit
zinit light Piotr1215/zsh-jumper

# antigen
antigen bundle Piotr1215/zsh-jumper

# oh-my-zsh
git clone https://github.com/Piotr1215/zsh-jumper \
    ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-jumper
# then add zsh-jumper to plugins in .zshrc
```

Default binding: `Ctrl+X /`

## Why Word Numbering?

The picker shows numbered words:

```
1: kubectl
2: get
3: -n
4: --user
5: admin
```

This prevents ambiguity. If you search for `-u`, you want `-n` at position 3, not a substring match inside `--user`. Numbers ensure exact cursor placement.

## Configuration

All options via zstyle, set before loading the plugin:

```zsh
# Force specific picker
zstyle ':zsh-jumper:' picker fzf

# Custom picker options
zstyle ':zsh-jumper:' picker-opts '--height=50% --reverse --border'

# Where cursor lands: start (default), middle, end
zstyle ':zsh-jumper:' cursor end

# Custom keybinding
zstyle ':zsh-jumper:' binding '^J'
```

For tmux users: the plugin auto-detects tmux and uses `fzf-tmux` for a floating popup instead of inline fzf.

## Vi Mode

If you use vi mode in zsh, bind to both insert and command modes:

```zsh
zstyle ':zsh-jumper:' disable-bindings yes
bindkey -M viins '^X/' zsh-jumper-widget
bindkey -M vicmd '^X/' zsh-jumper-widget
```

## Workflow Tips

After jumping to a word:

- `Alt+D` - Delete word forward (remove it)
- `Ctrl+W` - Delete word backward
- `Ctrl+K` - Kill to end of line
- Just type - Insert before the word

Jump, delete, retype. Three keystrokes to fix any part of a long command.

## Multiline Commands

Works with backslash continuations:

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name my-container \
    --network host \
    nginx:latest
```

Line continuation characters are filtered out. You see only actual command tokens in the picker.

## Performance

Load time: ~0.2ms. Negligible impact on shell startup.

```
% zmodload zsh/zprof && source zsh-jumper.plugin.zsh && zprof
num  calls                time            self            name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1)    1           0.23     0.23  100.00%  zsh-jumper-setup-bindings
