### Introducing Just

This content is also available as an interactive workshop on
[killercoda.com](https://killercoda.com/decoder/scenario/just)

It's like a Makefile just better
--------------------------------

Every project needs to orchestrate commands; whether for testing,
building, creating components, infrastructure and many many more. This
is typically done via a Makefile or bash scripts. The problem with make
is that it is designed as a tool to \*build\_C source code, it \_can\*
run commands but that's not its purpose. This means that when using
Makefile we take on the whole unnecessary baggage of the build part.

Bash scripts are a bit better but after a while when more scripts are
created, managing them and their dependencies becomes a nightmare.

There is a tool that combines best of both worlds;
[just](https://github.com/casey/just) is similar to make, but focused on
commands orchestration.

### Installation

Next we will install just and set up a simple justfile to see how it
works.

```{=bash}
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh \
    | bash -s -- --to /usr/local/bin
```
We can confirm that the installation was succesfull by running

```{=bash}
just --version
```
### Setting up sample project

Create a directory for the sample project

```{=bash}
mkdir -p ./just-example && cd ./just-example
```
Create a justfile in the project directory

```{=bash}
cat << 'EOF' > justfile
# This is a comment
hello:
    echo "Hello, World!"
EOF
```
### Running the first command

Now we can run the hello command \> *üí° by default just will run first
recipe in the justfile if we don't specify one*

```{=bash}
just
```
Basic Syntax
------------

Next we will learn basic commands and syntax of just. \> *üí° Commands in
justfile are called recipes.*

We can use @ to suppress printing the command to the terminal. This is
useful when we want to show only command output and not the command
itself.

### Suppressing command

```{=bash}
cat << 'EOF' >> justfile
supress_command:
    @echo "Only this is printed"
full_command:
    echo "Both command and output are printed"
EOF
```
Now we can run the supress\_command and full\_command commands

```{=bash}
just supress_command
just full_command
```
### Running faulty recipes will fail early

Recipes will fail if any of the commands return non-zero exit code.

```{=bash}
cat << 'EOF' >> justfile
fail_recipe:
    @ls /non-existing-dir
    @echo "This is never printed"
EOF

just fail_recipe
```
### Recipes can have dependencies.

```{=bash}
cat << 'EOF' >> justfile
dependency:
    @echo "This is the dependency"
dependent: dependency
    @echo "This is the dependent"
EOF

just dependent
```
### Running multiple recipes

```{=bash}
cat << 'EOF' >> justfile
recipe1:
    @echo "This is recipe1"
recipe2:
    @echo "This is recipe2"
EOF

just recipe1 recipe2
```
### Default recipe

If we don't specify a recipe, just will run the first recipe in the

justfile. We can specify a default recipe by using default as the recipe
name.

```{=bash}
{
    echo "default:"
    echo "    just --list"
    echo ""
    cat justfile
} | sponge justfile

just
```
Notice that running just this time simply printed the list of recipes.
\> *üí° comments on top of recipes are used as descriptions when running
just --list*

Real-life example
-----------------

There are many more features in just that we can explore. Next we will
look an at example production ready justfile

Let's start by cloning a repository with the justfile and checking all
the recipes in it.

```{=bash}
cd ../
git clone https://github.com/Piotr1215/crossplane-box.git
cd crossplane-box

just
```
> *üìì This justfile contains a set of recipes that help you to manage
> your Crossplane installation. You can find more information about the
> recipes in the [Crossplane Box
> Blog](https://resources.upbound.io/blogs/crossplane-in-a-box-your-toolkit-for-fast-prototyping-and-testing)*

### Settings

Just supports a set of settings that you can use to customize the
behavior of the runner. For example:

```{=bash}
set export
set shell := ["bash", "-uc"]
```
This tells just to export all variables and to use bash -uc for every
shell execution where the -c flag tells bash to run commands specified
as text and -u to treat unset variables as an error.

### Built-in Functions

Just provides a set of builtin functions. For example:

```{=bash}
yaml          := justfile_directory() + "/yaml"
apps          := justfile_directory() + "/apps"
```
This tells just to define two variables yaml and apps that point to the
specific directories regardless where the justfile directory is located.

It is also easy to detect operatin system and conditionally execute
different commands:

```{=bash}
browse        := if os() == "linux" { "xdg-open "} else { "open" }
copy          := if os() == "linux" { "xsel -ib"} else { "pbcopy" }
replace       := if os() == "linux" { "sed -i"} else { "sed -i '' -e" }
```
Here we can see that browse, copy, and replace functions are defined
based on the operating system. Those can be used later in the recipes
like this:

`kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" \| base64 -d \| {{copy}}`

### Recipe Parameters

Just allows you to define parameters for the recipes. For example:

```{=bash}
# setup kind cluster
setup_kind cluster_name='control-plane':
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  set -euo pipefail
echo "Creating kind cluster - {{cluster_name}}"
  envsubst < kind-config.yaml | kind create cluster --config - --wait 3m
  kind get kubeconfig --name {{cluster_name}}
  kubectl config use-context kind-{{cluster_name}}
```
Here we can see that the setup\_kind recipe takes a parameter
cluster\_name which has a default value of control-plane.

### Control Flow Recipes

It's very easy to string together various recipes in a sequence. For
example:

```{=bash}
# * setup kind cluster with crossplane, ArgoCD and launch argocd in browser
setup: _replace_repo_user setup_kind setup_crossplane setup_argo launch_argo
```
Here we can see that the setup recipe is a sequence of other recipes.
This is useful when all commands are well tested and we want to quickly
execute them in a sequence.

Advanced Features
-----------------

Next we will look at some advanced features of just. Just offers a lot
of flexibility and power to define and execute recipes. It is
continuously being improved and has a very active community. Here are
some advanced features that helped me to write complex recipes:

### Using Shell Recipes

just allows you to define recipes in any shell language. This is very
useful when you need to write complex shell scripts. For example:

```{=bash}
# setup kind cluster
setup_kind cluster_name='control-plane':
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  set -euo pipefail
echo "Creating kind cluster - {{cluster_name}}"
  envsubst < kind-config.yaml | kind create cluster --config - --wait 3m
  kind get kubeconfig --name {{cluster_name}}
  kubectl config use-context kind-{{cluster_name}}
```
Notice the \#!/usr/bin/env bash shebang at the beginning of the recipe.
This means that the recipe is executed by single bash subshell and can
share variables context.

### Commands Evaluation

Variables' values are evaluated at runtime. This means that you can use

```{=bash}
date_suffix                      := `echo test_$(date +%F)`
```
This will allow using the date\_suffix variable in the recipes, and it
will add suffix with test\_(current date). Let's try it out:

```{=bash}
cat <<EOF >> justfile 
date_suffix                      := \`echo test_\$(date +%F)\`
add_suffix:
  echo "Adding date suffix: {{date_suffix}}"
EOF
```
### Just Scripts

Adding \#!/usr/bin/env -S just --justfile shebang to the script allows
calling just recipes directly as if they were scripts. This is very
useful when working with system-wide scripts. For example, I use this
alias to call just recipe that sets up my kind cluster with crossplane.

```{=bash}
alias uxp="just ~/dev/dotfiles/scripts/uxp-setup/setup_infra"
```
This allows me to call uxp from anywhere in the system and it will
execute the setup\_infra recipe.

### Interactive Mode

Just has an interactive mode that allows you to select recipes from the
list using the --choose flag. Another alias I like to use is:

```{=bash}
.j: aliased to just --justfile ~/dev/dotfiles/scripts/uxp-setup/justfile --working-directory ~/dev/dotfiles/scripts/uxp-setup --choose
```
Closing Thoughts
----------------

We have *just* scratched the surface of what just can do. Read more
about features in just
[documentation](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_22.html).

We have *just* scratched the surface of just's capabilities. This
powerful tool can orchestrate a wide range of commands for various
tasks, offering flexibility and simplicity.

The combination of just's command orchestration and shell-like syntax
makes it a versatile tool for managing complex workflows.
