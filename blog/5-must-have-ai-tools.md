# Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not just a buzzword; it’s a
transformative force reshaping industries across the globe. The U.S. AI
market alone is projected to reach approximately $594 billion by 2032,
growing at a robust CAGR of 19% from 2023. This staggering growth
underscores AI’s pivotal role in driving innovation and efficiency.

If you’re not leveraging AI in your workflows yet, you might be missing
out on significant opportunities. AI is rapidly becoming a critical
component in staying competitive, and those who adopt AI tools now are
positioning themselves at the forefront of technological advancement.

In this blog, I would like to show you 5 tools that improved my
productivity and. You don’t need to be a software developer or IT
professional to take advantage of the same efficiencty boost.

## Let’s look at some statistics

## **Why the Terminal?**

You are probably familiar with ChatGPT or Claude web interfaces and
those are great first steps to try out generative AI. However, those web
UIs have important limitations; they are generic and not tailored to
specific needs. While convenient, they lack the flexibility to integrate
seamlessly with custom workflows and automate repetitive tasks.

The command line is a powerful interface that offers more control,
efficiency and flexibility than graphical interfaces. It allows for
scripting, automation, and quick access to powerful tools without the
overhead of a graphical interface.

> AI is revolutionizing the way we interact with technology. By
> integrating AI with command line tools, we can automate complex tasks,
> gain deeper insights from data, and improve overall productivity.

## **It’s Easier Than You Think**

Using AI tools in the terminal is straightforward. Many tools provide
simple installation commands and detailed documentation to help you get
started quickly.

Command line tools often offer more granular control over their
operation, allowing you to customize your workflows to suit your
specific needs.

## Better Automation

Terminal-based AI tools excel at automation. They can be easily
integrated into shell scripts, scheduled with cron jobs, and used in
combination with other command line utilities to create powerful
automated workflows.

# Tools

Before we jump into the tooling overview, let’s make sure we are on the
same page, defining what’s what in the terminal universe. Put simply:

![Terminal Related Definitions](_media/984983_image5.jpg)

## Ollama

A command-line tool developed my Meta, that allows you to run AI models
locally, enabling seamless and secure interactions with various LLMs
directly from your terminal. Chat or interact with AI models through
APIs on your local machine or a remote server in home network or
somewhere else.

- ollama/ollama: Get up and running with Llama 3, Mistral, Gemma, and other large language…

## Fabric

An open-source framework designed to augment human capabilities using
AI. It offers a modular system for solving specific problems through a
crowdsourced set of AI prompts, known as Patterns.

Fabric enables users to integrate AI into their daily tasks seamlessly,
from summarizing content to generating social media posts. It emphasizes
usability with a command-line interface and clear Markdown-based
patterns. The tool also supports creating personal AI infrastructures,
making it a versatile choice for both simple and complex AI
applications.

- danielmiessler/fabric: fabric is an open-source framework for augmenting humans using AI…

However, we can do better than this and let `fabric` speak for itself
using its `— agent` flag:

```bash
echo "research the https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric repository and summarize what the tool does" \
      | fabric --agents | summarize
```

This gives us the following response:

## Shell Automation

There are so many commands with flags and options that it’s impossible
to remember… thinking about you `ffmpeg` . To make this easier for
myself, I have created a tool that helps me with various commands.

- Piotr1215/aicmdtools: GoAI is a Go library and command line for interacting with OpenAI…

## Terminal Chat

Terminal chat apps are similar to `ollama` but allow for talking to
various LLM providers such as OpenAI, Claude and more. Here are two I’ve
experimented with and can recommend.

However, I usually use AI chats through `neovim`, more on it later in a
bonus section\!


- sigoden/aichat: All-in-one AI CLI tool that integrates 20+ AI platforms, including OpenAI…


- ekkinox/yai: Your AI powered terminal assistant.

perfect, it’s the closest I know to GitHub Copilot (with chat function)
and it’s completely free\!

Let’s see if fabric can help us capture the main strengths of aider.
Let’s paste the content or aider’s repo README.md and let fabric
summarize it.

```bash
xclip -o -sel clipboard | summarize
```

user-friendly design.  
5\. Aider’s recognition in benchmarks underscores its effectiveness in
addressing real-world coding challenges.

# Bonus for NeoVim Nerds

If you happen to use the best editor known to mankind… `neovim` btw, you
are in for a treat. Neovim plugins ecosystem, due to adopting `lua` as
plugins programming language, is very strong and versatile. Here are two
plugins that I use almost daily when coding, creating documentation or
chatting with `LLMs`.

## Gen.nvim

Let’s us use locall ollama models as a neovim copilot.

## Gp.nvim

Provides rich chat experience and copilot-like functionality in the
editor.
