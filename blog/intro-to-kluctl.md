Kubernetes has revolutionized the way we manage containerized
applications, providing a robust and scalable platform for deploying,
scaling, and operating these applications. However, despite its powerful
capabilities, managing Kubernetes deployments can sometimes be
challenging. Popular tools like Helm and Kustomize have become the
standard for many teams, but they might not always meet every need.

This is where Kluctl steps in. Kluctl is a deployment tool for
Kubernetes that aims to combine the strengths of Helm and Kustomize
while addressing their limitations. It provides a more flexible and
declarative approach to Kubernetes deployments, making it an excellent
choice for those seeking an alternative.

Installing Kluctl
-----------------

Getting started with Kluctl is straightforward. The following steps will
guide you through the installation process, allowing you to set up
Kluctl on your local machine and prepare it for managing your Kubernetes
deployments.

### Step 1: Install Kluctl CLI

First, you need to install the Kluctl command-line interface (CLI). The
CLI is the primary tool you'll use to interact with Kluctl.

To install the Kluctl CLI, run the following command:

```{=bash}
curl -sSL https://github.com/kluctl/kluctl/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```
This script downloads and installs the latest version of Kluctl. After
the installation is complete, verify that Kluctl has been installed
correctly by checking its version:

```{=bash}
kluctl version
```
You should see output indicating the installed version of Kluctl,
confirming that the installation was successful.

### Step 2: Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster

Before you can use Kluctl, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster up and
running. Kluctl interacts with your cluster to manage deployments, so
it's essential to ensure that you have a functioning Kubernetes
environment. If you haven't set up a Kubernetes cluster yet, you can
refer to [my previous
blogs](https://itnext.io/kubernetes-in-a-box-7a146ba9f681) for detailed
instructions on setting up clusters using various tools and services
like Minikube, Kind, GKE, EKS, or AKS.

Kluctl in action
----------------

Next we will setup a basic kluctl project. To start using kluctl define
a *.kluctl.yaml* file in the root of your project with the targets where
you want to deploy.

Let's create a folder for our project and create a *.kluctl.yaml *file
in it.

```{=bash}
mkdir kluctl-project && cd kluctl-project

cat <<EOF > .kluctl.yaml
discriminator: "kluctl-demo-{{ target.name }}"

targets:
  - name: dev
    context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes
    args:
      environment: dev
  - name: prod
    context: kubernetes-admin@kubernetes
    args:
      environment: prod

args:
  - name: environment
EOF
```
This file defines two targets, dev and prod, that will deploy to the
same Kubernetes cluster.

We can use the args section to define the arguments that we will use in
our YAML files to template them. For example `{{ args.environment }}`
would output dev or prod depending on the target we are deploying to.

### Create Deployment

Next we will create a kustomize deployment for *redis* application.
Under the hood kluctl uses kustomize to manage the Kubernetes manifests.
kustomize is a tool that lets you customize raw, template-free YAML
files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML untouched and
usable as is. \> *💡 we are following a tutorial from the kluctl
documentation [Basic Project Setup
Introduction](https://kluctl.io/docs/tutorials/microservices-demo/1-basic-project-setup/)*

Let's create a deployment.yaml where we will define elements that kluctl
will use to deploy the application.

```{=bash}
cat <<EOF > deployment.yaml
deployments:
  - path: redis

commonLabels:
  examples.kluctl.io/deployment-project: "redis"
EOF
```
Now we need to create redis the deployment folder.

mkdir redis && cd redis

Since we are using kustomize we need to create a kustomization.yaml
file.

```{=bash}
cat <<EOF > kustomization.yaml
resources:
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
EOF
```
And now we can create the service.yaml and deployment.yaml files.

```{=bash}
cat <<EOF > deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-cart
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis-cart
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis-cart
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis:alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
        readinessProbe:
          periodSeconds: 5
          tcpSocket:
            port: 6379
        livenessProbe:
          periodSeconds: 5
          tcpSocket:
            port: 6379
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
          name: redis-data
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 256Mi
            cpu: 125m
          requests:
            cpu: 70m
            memory: 200Mi
      volumes:
      - name: redis-data
        emptyDir: {}
EOF

cat <<EOF > service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-cart
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: redis-cart
  ports:
  - name: redis
    port: 6379
    targetPort: 6379
EOF
```
### Deploy the app

Next, we will deploy the *redis* application to the dev target. First,
we need to change to the root of the kluctl-project repository and
initialize a git repository there.

```{=bash}
cd /root/kluctl-project && \
   git init && \
   git add . && \
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
Now we can deploy the application to dev environment.

```{=bash}
kluctl deploy --yes -t dev
```
> *💡 Notice that we are using the --yes flag to avoid the confirmation
> prompt. This is useful for the scenario, but in real life you should
> always review the changes before applying them.*

### Handling Changes

Next we will introduce changes to our setup and see how kluctl handles
them. Let's see what we have deployed so far by executing tree command.

```{=bash}
.
|-- deployment.yaml
|-- kustomization.yaml
`-- redis
    |-- deployment.yaml
    |-- kustomization.yaml
    `-- service.yaml

1 directory, 5 files
```
> *💡 Notice this resembles a typical kustomize directory structure.*

One of the superpowers of kluctl is how transparently it handles
changes. Let's modify the redis deployment and see how kluctl handles
it.

`yq -i eval '.spec.replicas = 2' redis/deployment.yaml`

Now let's deploy the changes to the dev target.

`kluctl deploy --yes -t dev`

Remember at the beginning, we have added custom labels to each
deployment. Let's see if the labels were correctly applied.

`kubectl get deployments -A --show-labels`

### Templating

Next, we will use templating capabilities of kluctl to deploy the same
application to a different namespace At the beginning of the workshop,
we have two different environments; prod and dev. This setup works out
of the box for multiple targets (clusters), however in our case, we want
to have a single target (cluster) and we want to deploy different
targets to different namespaces.

Let's start by deleting the existing resources and modifying some files.
\> *💡 It is possible to migrate the resources to a different namespace
using the kluctl prune command. However, in this case, we will delete
the old resources and recreate them in new namespaces.*

`kluctl delete --yes -t dev`

In order to differentiate between the two environments, we will need to
adjust the discriminator field in the .kluctl.yaml file.

`yq e '.discriminator = "kluctl-demo-{{ target.name }}-{{
args.environment }}"' -i .kluctl.yaml`

We also need to create a namespace folder and yaml and add it to our
kustomization.yaml file.

First create the namespace folder.

`mkdir namespace`

Now we can add the namespace folder to the kustomization.yaml file. \>
*💡 Notice the use of barrier: true in the kustomization.yaml file. This
tells kluctl to apply the resources in the order they are defined in the
file and wait for the resource before the barrier to be ready before
applying the next ones*

```{=bash}
cat <<EOF > deployment.yaml
deployments:
  - path: namespace
  - barrier: true
  - path: redis
commonLabels:
  examples.kluctl.io/deployment-project: "redis"
overrideNamespace: kluctl-demo-{{ args.environment }}
EOF
```
Now let's create the namespace YAML file.

```{=bash}
cat <<EOF > ./namespace/namespace.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: kluctl-demo-{{ args.environment }}
EOF
```
### Test the deployment

We will test if our setup works by deploying the redis application to
the dev and prod namespaces. Deploying the resources to the dev
namespace:

```{=bash}
kluctl deploy --yes -t dev
```
And to the prod namespace:

```{=bash}
kluctl deploy --yes -t prod
```
Let's check if everything deployed as expected:

```{=bash}
kubectl get pods,svc -n kluctl-demo-dev
kubectl get pods,svc -n kluctl-demo-prod
```
Closing thoughts
----------------

That's it! We have seen basic capabilities of kluctl.

We have barely scratched the surface of kluctl capabilities. You can use
it to deploy to multiple clusters, namespace, and even different
environments.

The mix of templating capabilities based on jinja2 and kustomize
architecture makes it a really flexible tool for complex deployments.
