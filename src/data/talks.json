Well, all of those statements are true, but most importantly, Kubernetes is everywhere and its popularity will only grow, as it fades to the background powering workloads on servers in public, private and hybrid clouds, on edge and even in space. Big part of DevOps movement is 'learning culture'. Companies expect more from new and seasoned employees, technologies come and go with neck breaking speed. One proven way of continuously learning is investing in yourself by learning and validating your knowledge with a certificate. CNCF created 3 Kubernetes certifications, one for administrators: CKA, for developers: CKAD and security specialists: CKS. During this talk we will look into learning process, certification details and I will share with you tips and tricks on how to pass the exams."
