   "abstract": "Let's define desired characteristics of software documentation to fit into modern, rapid pace of development. Documentation should be Simple to decrease maintenance effort and make sure all stakeholders can understand the core concepts. Holistic to account for different types of documentation consumers requiring different contexts. Automated to ensure maintenance over time with minimal impact on development teams. Reusable across software projects with a structured but flexible documentation model. Portable to generate and distribute documentation independently on any hosting medium."

   "abstract": "Some say that Kubernetes is a fabric for cloud native applications, platform to build platforms or operating system of the cloud. Well, all of those statements are true, but most importantly, Kubernetes is everywhere and its popularity will only grow, as it fades to the background powering workloads on servers in public, private and hybrid clouds, on edge and even in space. Big part of DevOps movement is 'learning culture'. Companies expect more from new and seasoned employees, technologies come and go with neck breaking speed. One proven way of continuously learning is investing in yourself by learning and validating your knowledge with a certificate. CNCF created 3 Kubernetes certifications, one for administrators: CKA, for developers: CKAD and security specialists: CKS. During this talk we will look into learning process, certification details and I will share with you tips and tricks on how to pass the exams."
